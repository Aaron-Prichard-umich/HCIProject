## Phase 3: Sketches and Prototype

### Design Rationale

In this project, we came up with three collaborative sketches for this problem. The difference between them mainly stems from how the settings are organized. In sketch #1, all of the settings are together on one screen, while on sketch #2, the settings are split up into different screens, and in sketch #3 there are tabs for the different groups of settings, as well as a pop up for advanced settings. The other difference is that sketch #1 has removed power plans. Sketch #1 has the advantage of keeping everything on one screen. Sketch #2 and #3 both allow some level of splitting up to make things less cluttered. In the end we picked sketch #1 because we believe the user will have an easier time finding things.

We incorporated a few things we learned from our contextual inquiry into our design. First, we made sure that settings are easily accessible without having to navigate to another screen. In addition, we kept the duration the screen and the device stay on at the very beginning, since it is very common for users to want to change those settings. Finally, we made sure to put related settings together.

### Hardware Assumptions

Our user interface is to replace the power and sleep settings on windows. Because of that, our target device is mainly laptop and desktop computers. These kinds of devices usually have mice, although sometimes they can have touchscreens.

### User Assumptions

We expect all kinds of users to want to change the power settings on their devices. This includes users that may not be familiar with computers.
